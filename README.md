# Microsoft-Rewards-Bot

Instructions:
1. Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/
2. Download Microsoft Edge driver from https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver
3. Open the .py file with the Notepad and set the pathing where you downloaded the Edge driver using this format: `C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\\Microsoft Rewards Bot\\Microsoft Rewards Bot\\msedgedriver.exe` (line 20)

Important:
- If you don't use the double backslash `\\` between each subfolder (point 3.) it won't work
- If the program crashes before opening Edge, that means you have to download the newer version of the Edge driver (just follow again point 2.). Then you have to replace it in the SAME position as the previous one without changing the name
